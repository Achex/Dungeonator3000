Third year disseration project of my Computer Science MEng degree at the University of Warwick, awarded a first.

This program requires running an instance of Stable Diffusion with ControlNet on a publicly accessible link, for example through Gradio, or locally if your machine has powerful enough GPUs (see Stable Diffusion documentation for required system specs).

Watch the project in action:
